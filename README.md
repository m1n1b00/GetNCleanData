Preparing a tida set from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Pre-processing steps
1. Download the dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your R working directory
2. Unzip the dataset into a directory (by default) name *UCI HAR Dataset*

Additional information about the dataset can be found at the UCI Machine Learning website - [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 

## Running the code
You can now execute the R script by opening run_analysis.R in R or RStudio.  The script will output the dataset tidyData.txt
